# Task Tracker for AI_Technical_Analysis Project

This file tracks key development tasks for organizing, improving, and extending the functionality of the AI-based stock and crypto analysis application.

## ‚úÖ Project Setup & Structure
- [x] Create a `frontend/` folder for all Streamlit UI components
- [x] Create a `backend/` folder for data processing, model logic, and utility functions
- [x] Add a `memorybank.mdc/` folder for tracking persistent dev notes and ideas
- [x] Create `progress.md` to document weekly learning and project updates
- [x] Create `task.md` for active and future tasks (this file)

## üõ†Ô∏è Current & Upcoming Tasks

### 1. üîÑ Refactor Code into Frontend/Backend Structure
**Status**: In Progress  
**Description**: Move all UI-related code (Streamlit layout, user inputs, charts) into the frontend/ folder and backend logic (data fetching, analysis, ML models) into the backend/ folder.  
**Goal**: Improve readability, scalability, and maintenance.

### 2. üñºÔ∏è Add Logo Support for Stocks and Cryptocurrencies
**Status**: New  
**Objective**: Display company or crypto logos next to their tickers in the dashboard to improve UX.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `assets/logos/` folder to store local icons
- [ ] Implement `get_logo_url(ticker)` function:
  - [ ] First check local `/logos` directory
  - [ ] Then try external API sources:
    - Stocks: Clearbit Logo API or Yahoo CDN
    - Crypto: CoinGecko API
  - [ ] Fallback to a default icon if no match is found
- [ ] Display logos in the Streamlit dashboard (resized & styled)
- [ ] Cache external logo requests to reduce latency
- [ ] Bonus: Add dark-mode friendly icons if available

### 3. üì¶ Package Dependencies and Setup
**Status**: Planned

- [x] Add a `requirements.txt` file
- [ ] Create `setup.sh` or enhance `README.md` instructions for quick project setup
- [ ] Add environment validation checks
- [ ] Create virtual environment setup instructions

### 4. üìä Improve Chart Interactivity
**Status**: Planned

- [ ] Use Plotly or Altair for interactive candlestick and line charts
- [ ] Enable hover tooltips with detailed information
- [ ] Add zoom functionality
- [ ] Implement dynamic technical indicators
- [ ] Add chart type selection (candlestick, line, OHLC)
- [ ] Support multiple timeframes

### 5. üîê Security & API Key Management
**Status**: Planned

- [ ] Move sensitive keys to `.env` file
- [ ] Add `.env.example` and update `.gitignore`
- [ ] Implement API key validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Set up error handling for API failures

### 6. üì± Responsive Design & UX Improvements
**Status**: Planned

- [ ] Make dashboard mobile-friendly
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Implement error messages with helpful suggestions
- [ ] Add tooltips for technical indicators
- [ ] Create a help/documentation section

### 7. üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance
**Status**: Planned

- [ ] Set up unit testing framework
- [ ] Add integration tests for API calls
- [ ] Create test data fixtures
- [ ] Implement UI testing with Selenium
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline

### 8. üéØ Implement Key AI Features
**Status**: Planned

**Tasks**:
- [ ] ML for Predictive Analytics Implementation
  - [ ] Set up Prophet model integration
  - [ ] Add predictive analytics dashboard
  - [ ] Implement model training interface
  
- [ ] Algorithmic Strategies Module

## Task: Integrate and Use Design References for Frontend

**Description**: Add 5 design reference images to `frontend/assets/design_references/`. These images will guide the visual direction of the dashboard.

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Store the following images in the `design_references/` folder:
  - layout_reference.png
  - typography_reference.png
  - color_palette.png
  - chart_styling.png
  - component_spacing.png
- [ ] Update `memorybank.mdc/design_notes.md` to explain the role of each image.
- [ ] Ensure any AI or dev task related to frontend references these images.
- [ ] During frontend development, consult `design_notes.md` to stay visually consistent.

**Priority**: High
